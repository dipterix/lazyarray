# Lazyarray - R package to store/read large array on hard drive

This package is NOT active anymore. Please consider [filearray](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=filearray), a long-term project.

You might see `lazyarray` on CRAN, this is because I have some legacy projects that depend on this package. This package will be off CRAN anytime soon. (Sorry...)
